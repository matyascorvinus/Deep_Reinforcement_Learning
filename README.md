# ReinforcementLearning

This is the repository for learning the fundamental of Reinforcement Learning - a paradigm of machine learning that deals with how software agents carry out the task efficiently based on the environment. 
The exercises are provided by Udacity courses, and all the algorithm are implemented in PyTorch. 
List of Folders:
- p1_navigation: Project Navigation for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning courses.
- p2_continuous-control: Project Continuous Control for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning courses.
- finance: Udacity's example of using Deep Reinforcement Learning on trading in the stock market, I used this for my personal learning ground.
The environment for the agents are listed belows:
- OpenAI Gym: [Repository](https://github.com/openai/gym), [Installation Guidelines](https://medium.com/@sayanmndl21/install-openai-gym-with-box2d-and-mujoco-in-windows-10-e25ee9b5c1d5)
- ml-agents: [Repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents)
