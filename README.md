# ReinforcementLearning

This is the repository for learning the fundamental of Reinforcement Learning - a paradigm of machine learning that deals with how software agents carry out the task efficiently based on the environment. 
The exercises are provided by Udacity courses, and all the algorithm are implemented in PyTorch. 
The environment for the agents are listed belows:
- OpenAI Gym: [Repository](https://github.com/openai/gym), [Installation Guidelines](https://medium.com/@sayanmndl21/install-openai-gym-with-box2d-and-mujoco-in-windows-10-e25ee9b5c1d5)
- ml-agents: [Repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents)
